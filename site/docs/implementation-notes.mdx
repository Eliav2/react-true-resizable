# Implementation Notes

`react-true-resizable` is a React components that is written with modern React techniques and uses modern web API.

`react-true-resizable` does not mutate the style of the target DOM node except for the `width` and `height` properties
(in order to make the node resizable), and `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box` (in order to place the handles correctly).

the `position` property does not being mutated, and no DOM node is created and wrapped around the target node therefore the layout
of the target DOM node will not be affected.

other resizable solutions are setting the `position` property to `relative` or `absolute` in order to place the handles correctly,
this lib uses different approach to place the handles and using [getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) in
order to calculate the wanted position of the handles, and placing them relative to their absolute positioned parent which will
be injected as a children of the target DOM node using ReactPortal.
