# Usage

`react-true-resizable` is a React components that is written with modern React techniques and uses modern web API.

`react-true-resizable` does not mutate the style of DOM node is wrapped around except for the `width` and `height` properties
in order to make the node resizable, and `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box` (in order to place the handles correctly).

the `position` property does not change. therefore it will work as expected no matter what the position of the node is.
also, no DOM node is created and wrapped around the target node, so the surrounding layout won't be affected.
other resizable solutions are setting the `position` property to `relative` or `absolute` in order to place the handles correctly,
this lib uses different approach to place the handles and using [getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) in
order to calculate the actual position of the handles.
